# Newsletter-Service-Python
So this an academic solo project where i was given a task to build a newsletter service using the python programming language.
Created two seperate files one which handels the subscription feature, i.e a feature to let the user subscribe or unsubscribe to the service.
The other is for the main system to send any desired content via email by using the python. I used the smtplib library to make things easier and more functional.
